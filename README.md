2. **Next, run the JAR file:**

```
TARGET_AREA=<directory_path>
cp target/scala-2.12/spark-sbt-template-assembly-1.0.jar $TARGET_AREA
```

```
JAR_AREA=$(pwd)/target/scala-2.12/spark-sbt-template-assembly-1.0.jar
spark-submit --master=local[*] --deploy-mode client --class App $JAR_AREA
```


## Deploying the Project on AWS

1. Login to AWS  and Upload access log file into S3 Bucket if existing, otherwise create one and do the Upload.

This is achieved by clicking on **"Upload"** then **"Add Files"** from the S3 Bucket console in the image below: 

The project files with the jar file is also uploaded as shown below:

10. Click on Create cluster

12. Click on the refresh icon to see the status passing from Starting to Running to Terminating â€” All steps completed

13. Add the jar file to the cluster specifying "Application Location" uploaded unto the S3 bucket with argument -s s3://project5datas3b1/access.log.gz -r s3://project5datas3b1/WebLogAnalysisWithScala/src/res/reports

Application Location is:
s3://project5datas3b1/WebLogAnalysisWithScala/SparkLogAnalysis-assembly-1.0.jar

And with
